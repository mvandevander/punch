# punch
A Windows CLI app for keeping track of time spent on personal projects

USAGE:

Simply run punch from the command line and you will now be punched in. When you run punch again, you will be punched out and the total time that you were punched in will be stored.

To clear the total punched time, run punch -c. 

To simply read the total punched time and see your current status, run punch -r.
